- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kanai-06
- 👀 I’m interested in alot of things but especially coding anything that comes up to my imagination. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development through the odin project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects once i've advanced in my learning journey.
- 📫 How to reach me: I will create designated social media and mail accounts someday, but for now you can just message me on Github. We can message on Github right ?
